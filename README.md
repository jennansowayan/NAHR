# NAHR

This project consists of a platform to advertise and showcase courses provided by institutions or websites, that are available for individuals across the kingdom- free of charge. It aims to help individuals, whether graduates or undergraduates, in finding opportunities to improve their skills and enhance their CVâ€™s in an easy and personalized way, with the use of a recommendation engine that can collect user data and use it to tailor their experience on our platform. 

With Nahr, we have succeeded to build a solid foundation, and more, for what we hope will become a staple for students and ambitious individuals throughout KSA. In the future, we hope to work with course providers who seek to advertise their courses to users through our application. We also hope that with more user data, specifically implicit data, we can further enhance our recommender system to make it more efficient. Our main goal has always been to benefit the youth and better prepare them for their future, bearing this in mind future improvements for Nahr look like:
Profile page where users can edit their interests and showcase certifications.
Language support for Arabic-speaking users and other commonly-used languages.
Allow users to sign up for courses directly through the website. 
Allowing users to link their Nahr profile in other social media platforms such as LinkedIn to appeal to more employers.
